- Create your own repository for the lab
- Automatically set up your workspace with the starter code

### Step 1: Clone Your Repository

Once your repository is created, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/welcome-cpan252-lab0.git
cd welcome-cpan252-lab0

## 📋 Lab 0 Overview

Lab 0 has **2 parts**:

### Part 1: GitHub Setup & First Pull Request (30 minutes)
Learn the GitHub workflow:
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Add your name to the submissions file
4. Create and submit a Pull Request
5. Have it reviewed and merged

**Why?** You'll submit ALL labs via GitHub. This is practice!

### Part 2: Spring Dependency Injection Exercise (2 hours)
Build a Task Validation System:
1. Create domain models (User, Task)
2. Implement services with Spring annotations
3. Use Dependency Injection (@Autowired)
4. Run the application and see DI in action

**Why?** DI is the foundation of Spring. Everything else builds on this!
